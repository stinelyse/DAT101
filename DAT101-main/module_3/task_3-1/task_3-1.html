      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p> When the wake-up time is exactly 7, the if statement condition evaluates to true, and the message "I can take the bus to school" is printed.
        When the wake-up time is not 7, the if statement condition evaluates to false, so the program does not execute the block inside the if statement, so the message we got when the if statement was true(clock 7) is not being printed.</p>

      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behaviour of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>If the condition in the if statement is true (wakeup time is 7), the program prints out "I can take the bus to school". But when the wakeup time is not 7, the condition in the else statement triggers, and it will print put "I have to take the car to school".</p>

      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>If the wakeup time is less than 7 or greater than 8, the program will be using the else condition, because the conditions for taking the bus or train are not met. It will then print out " I have to take the car to school".</p>
      
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>If the number is zero, it will not print out positive or negative. This is because 0 is neither greater or less than 0, so it doesn't go under the Positive or Negative category. </p>
