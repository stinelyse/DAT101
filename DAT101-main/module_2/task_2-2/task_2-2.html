      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				[We should use constants when the value should not change during the program. Example when we use mathematics number, such as Pi, it is useful to use a constant. Constants is used as an assurance that values do not change while the program is running. 
        When we use variables during the program, we can change the values during the program. Variables do not need to have a value when they are created.  
        Example when we are going to calculate the userâ€™s age based on their birthyear, we need a variable to store the result because the value varies depending on what the user puts in.  
        While constants are important for unchanging values, variables is necessary for handling dynamic data. A functional program typically needs both constants and variables to work effectively.

      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				[Parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression because it can define the order of the operation. In arithmetic the operation inside the parentheses is performed first. ]
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				[To limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals we can use the toFixed() method. This method rounds a number to given numbers of digits. 
        We can also use math.round() method, it rounds a number to the nearest integer.
        ]
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				[We need to limit the floating-point numbers first, by forexample using toFixed() method or math.round(). Then we can use === to compare the two floating-point values to see if they are equal. 12.199999 and 12.2 will be the same. ]
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				[In javascript we use comparison operators to compare values and determine their relationship to eachother. These operators return a Boolean value (true or false). To check if they are true or false, we can use === (equal value and equal type) to check if it is false or true. There are more comparison operators, such as < (less than) and > (greater than) and also != =(not alike).]
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				[Math.random() returns a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive). It always returns a number lower than 1. It can be used to generate random numbers, colors or example choose random elements from a list. It can also be used to simulate a throw with a dice, or generated random password. ]
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				[The modulus operator (%) provides the remainder left over after dividing one number by another.
        We need this operator when we are example going to determining even or odd numbers, time calculations or managing repeating patterns in sequences.
